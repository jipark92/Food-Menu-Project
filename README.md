# Food-Menu-Project

For this javascript project, I will be working on a food menu page which can help a customer  narrow down searches and pick the choice of the food they want to eat. It seems hard at first, but when keep working on it. Things start clicking and you know what to do. This is the most realistc, fun, and hard difficulty webpage project I will try to accomplish.
